Scripts and other tools of random value. Not intended to be packaged,
more like aid to developers, admins, training purposes or a code library.
Each of the snippets is separate and may have separate authors.

For each, if they are or may be protected by copyright law, they MUST
be covered by an OSI-approved licence or CC0. (Otherwise, they are
obviously in the Public Domain. Note that PD dedications do not count
as these works will still be copyright-protected in other countries;
similar for e.g. USA government works. The “Unlicense” also is not a
licence, and so isn’t sufficient.) Things marked as not complicated
enough for copyright are assumed to not achieve whatever threshold of
originality required for such protection; all files marked thusly are
available under CC0 as fallback, should they not be free of copyright
protection in your legislation. IANA’s timezone database’s data files
exports are just PD-labelled, as facts.

For licencing conditions, look into each file separately.
