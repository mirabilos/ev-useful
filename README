Scripts and other tools of random value. Not intended to be packaged,
more like aid to developers, admins, training purposes or a code library.
Each of the snippets is separate and may have separate authors.

All of them MUST have an OSI approved licence, if copyright
law applies. (Otherwise, theyâ€™re obviously Public Domain.)
For licencing conditions, look into each file separately.
Things marked as not complicated enough for copyright are
assumed to not achieve the threshold of originality required
for such protection; as a fallback, all such files are also
available under any OSI approved licence, should they not be
in the Public Domain in your legislation.
