Scripts and other tools of random value. Not intended to be packaged,
more like aid to developers, admins, training purposes or a code library.
Each of the snippets is separate and may have separate authors.

For each, if they are or may be protected by copyright law, they MUST
be covered by an OSI-approved licence or CC0; CC0 works should have a
dual licence grant (Fedora doesn’t consider CC0 for code free enough).
(Otherwise, they are obviously in the Public Domain. PD dedications
do not count as these works will still be copyright-protected in other
countries; similar for e.g. USA government works. The “Unlicense” is
merely a badly worded PD dedication with no fallback licence and so is
not sufficient.) IANA’s timezone database exports are just PD-labelled,
as facts.

For licencing conditions, look into each file separately.
